# Strategy ideas

## In General:
World floods at turn 750 so we want to be on mars before then. No factories can be built on mars, so we need to take whatever we need with us. 

Building & launching a rocket is the most important thing to start. So blueprint rocket immediately and start saving up for it.

### Rocketship Party ideas:
You can have 8 total in a rocket. 
- 3 workers
- 2 rangers
- 2 healers
- 1 knight

The workers will harvest money and the rest seem like a balanced party to take on foes that arrive. 
More testing will reveal if this is a good balance but it's a place to start

## Workers

Blueprint rocket immediately.
Collect karbonite as much as possible until a rocket can be built.
Somewhere in there though we need to start making factories. we should have a few factories on Earth before the rocket is done. This is so we can make our dream rocket team, and also make more workers to get more karbonite etc.

## Knights
These are the tanks. They should focus entirely on combat, taking hits for the other types of robot and attacking the enemy when it gets near. 

## Mages
Mainly heal rockets and factories (is that possible? idk) 
Next, heal rogues, then knights, then workers. 
What about mage combat?

## Rogues
Get the snipe ability as soon as possible. in the meantime, focus on sabotaging the enemy. Once snipe is unlocked, attack enemy things in this order of importance:
1. Rockets
1. Factories
1. Mages
1. Rogues
1. Workers
1. Knights

my thinking is that knights are indestructible anyway so dont bother fighting them
